# cs231n

This repository contains mostly completed assignments for Stanford's [Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition](http://cs231n.github.io/). 

Some of the work has not been completed:
  - some parts of assignment 1 as most of that content had already been covered in my introductory machine learning course (cross-validation, SVM, etc.)
  - the PyTorch parts in assignments 2 and 3 as PyTorch isn't GPU accelerated on Windows
  
Everything else should be complete and pass the tests for correctness.
