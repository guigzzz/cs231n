# cs231n

This repository mostly completed assignments for Stanford's [Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition](http://cs231n.github.io/)

Some of the work has not been completely:
  - some parts of assignment 1 as most of that content had already been covered in my introductory machine learning course 
  - the PyTorch parts in assignment 3 as PyTorch isn't GPU accelerated on Windows
